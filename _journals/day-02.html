                        We have gallo pinto (beans and rice), plantains, and eggs for breakfast, pack, say goodbye to Yolanda, cross Rt. 38,
                        the main road from Limon to San Jose, and head up our first mountain on a gravel road. At first we pass large
                        estates, gated and foreboding. As we get farther from Rt 38 the homes become more modest, and more colorful the less
                        presumptuous they are. Near the top, we get a final view of the Atlantic. Orlando points to what he says is a cruise
                        ship in the Limon harbor. His vision is better than mine and I can only imagine that I can make it out. I take a
                        picture and enlarge it. Sure enough there is a white cruise ship in the harbor. I confess to Orlando that I couldn’t
                        see the ship. “You do see the girl in the yellow bikini, don’t you?” he asks. “Yeh, of course I can see her.”

                        Skittles and Drew go on ahead and are taking a rest break when we catch up. To the west, fading in the distance like
                        a Japanese wood cut, is a spectacular vista of the multiple ranges of mountains we will be crossing to get to
                        Quepos, the Pacific Ocean, and the end of our hike.

                        We pass by the farmer’s pasture where Gail and I had camped out under Orlando’s tarp the year before. We shared the
                        pasture with a hungry horse that chomped away during the night and a huge pig that was being saved for the Christmas
                        meal. Gail asked Orlando how they slaughter pigs in Costa Rica. “Either we shoot them in the head or hang them by
                        their back legs and cut their throat so they bleed out,” Orlando said.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “The last way was how we did it when I lived in Brazil,” I said. “But one time I made eye contact with a pig who was
                        bleeding out and when he looked back at me he said with his eyes, ‘why are you doing this to me?’ That was the last
                        time I had anything to do with slaughtering a pig.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Orlando said, “Something like that happened the time I was hunting monkeys. We shot a monkey who fell to the ground
                        and started stuffing a leaf in her wound to stop the bleeding. I raised my gun to kill her and she raised her hands
                        like she was surrendering. But that wasn’t the worst. We shot a second monkey and when I went up to get her I saw
                        that her baby was on her back. The baby started slapping her mom to make her come to life. I took the baby to the
                        tree where her father was, but before I could get back to the mother the baby returned and started slapping her
                        mother’s face again. Nunca mas. That was the last time I went hunting monkeys.”

                        But this time we pass by the farmer’s field. Our destination this day is a school where Orlando had arranged for us
                        to spend the night camping out on the school patio. The trail leads down, up, down, up and a final down before our
                        destination.

                    <p>
                        We are greeted by Waquin, the school watchman and our host. He is waiting with freshly brewed coffee when we show up
                        around 3:30. Drew fixes dinner for the five of us; a hot meal from a just-add-boiling-water-dehydrated-dinner-bag,
                        and finally a hot shower and rest.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Meanwhile Waquin, who must have been starving for someone to talk to, chats up Orlando. I can hear them still
                        talking as I fall asleep.

                        I wake on the floor of Yolanda's. We arrived last night and were fed a delicious dinner and allowed to sleep on the
                        concrete floor of a covered extension of the house. Walls of fencing. The Roosters started at 3am calling out to
                        each other, checking in. We are served a simple breakfast with meat and cheese.

                        Today we leave the flat lands of the coast and begin to climb. Coming from Denver the air here is thick, I feel
                        amazingly strong. Up and up a simple road that becomes more simple with altitude.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I read Charles Esenstine’s essay <a href="https://charleseisenstein.org/essays/the-ecosexual-awakening/">The Ecosexual Awakening</a> last night. I found it profound and validating in a way
                        that only confirmation bias can. As I hike I wonder if perhaps some biases are better confirmed. The universe and
                        all things are alive and conscious. We are not separate from this great tapestry. From the article:
                    </p>
                    <blockquote>
                        “Could the story of Lover Earth be that new story for civilization? Returned from our journey of separation, we
                        rejoin the tribe – the tribe of all life on Earth, the tribe of the living planet – and seek to contribute to the
                        wellbeing of all.”
                    </blockquote>
                    <p>
                        Reading this reinforces a feeling that I am on the right path, fitting as I start this hike.

                        The volcano Turrialba looms to our north. The road we hike turns to a small rough path along pastures. As the sun
