                        I have made two hikes across Costa Rica, one in December of 2017 with my friend Gail Haggard and one in December, 2018
                        with my son Drew and Rich Larson, aka Skittles. Both hikes were made with our guide, Orlando Zamares, who has crossed
                        the country more than 30 times.
                        Drew and I both wrote of our adventure.

                        Orlando is an expert guide. He has crossed Costa Rica over 30 times, guiding groups as diverse as Outward Bound kids to
                        solo hikers. Orlando was the first guide to cross the country on the new Camino de Costa Rica. Along the way he
                        introduced us to many of the friends he has made over the years, who offered us meals and places to stay. He filled our
                        hike with animal lore, reading tapir paw prints, calling quetzal birds into view, and recounting legends that have
                        become part of the fabric of the Costa Rican people.

                        Skittles is a long distance hiker. He needs to hike the Pacific Crest Trail a second time to become a double triple
                        crowner, having hiked both the Appalachian Trail and the Continental Divide Trail twice. He plans on doing it some day.
                        In addition to the PCT, AT, and CDT he‚Äôs thru hiked long distance trails in New Zealand, Australia, Patagonia and now
                        Costa Rica. He plans to keep a hike in Nepal, the E1 in Europe, and a self-planned route from south (Key West) to north
                        (Angle Inlet, Minn.) on his radar.

                    Conchita Espino and Marco Marin are spearheading the creation and development of the Camino de Costa Rica.

                <p>
                    Conchita says, ‚ÄúAfter hiking El Camino de Santiago Compostela with friends, it was apparent that hikers along El Camino
                    bring economic well-being to the small towns along its route. It was not a big leap to think that a similar hiking route
                    could be possible in Costa Rica. In Costa Rica most tourist dollars go to coastal areas in the Pacific and to some
                    selected hot spots, leaving the rest of the country, and in particular, rural areas without good sources of income.
                </p>
                <p>
                    ‚ÄúOur love for hiking, our wish to give others opportunities like we had enjoyed, and the great model that El Camino de
                    Santiago provided are the principle reasons for embarking on the challenge to create the Camino de Costa Rica. We found
                    our professional skills in organization development, strategic planning, and project management that we had acquired in
                    our professions served us well. We also found fertile ground in many Costa Rican‚Äôs who had had a similar idea when
                    hiking to Compostela, and we soon learned that the Costa Rican people in the small villages along the Camino de Costa
                    Rica welcomed the idea and became instant partners in this endeavor.‚Äù
